/**
 * gopal_manager_add_route_entry:
 * @self: #GopalManager instance
 * @spec: the specification of the route
 *
 *  Add a route entry to the route table.
 *
 * The specification string is of the form:
 *
 *          pattern '=' destination
 * where:
 *
 *          pattern      regular expression used to select route
 *          destination  destination for the call
 *
 * The "pattern" string regex is compared against routing strings that
 * are built as follows:
 *
 *          a_party '\\t' b_party
 *
 * where:
 *
 *          a_party      name associated with a local connection i.e.
 *                       "pots:vpb:1/2" or "h323:myname@myhost.com".
 *
 *          b_party      destination specified by the call, which may
 *                       be a full URI or a simple digit string
 *
 * Note that all "pattern" strings have an implied '^' at the
 * beginning and a '$' at the end. This forces the "pattern" to match
 * the entire source string. For convenience, the sub-expression
 * ".*\\t" is inserted immediately after any ':' character if no '\\t'
 * is present.
 *
 * Route entries are stored and searched in the route table in the
 * order they are added.
 *
 * The "destination" string is determines the endpoint used for the
 * outbound leg of the route, when a match to the "pattern" is
 * found. It can be a literal string, or can be constructed using
 * various meta-strings that correspond to parts of the source. See
 * below for a list of the available meta-strings
 *
 * A "destination" starting with the string 'label:' causes the router
 * to restart searching from the beginning of the route table using
 * the new string as the "a_party". Thus, a route table with the
 * folllwing entries:
 *
 *          "label:speeddial=h323:10.0.1.1"
 *          "pots:26=label:speeddial"
 *
 * will produce the same result as the single entry "pots:26=h323:10.0.1.1".
 *
 * If the "destination" parameter is of the form filename, then the
 * file is read with each line consisting of a pattern=destination
 * route specification.
 *
 * "destination" strings without an equal sign or beginning with '#'
 * are ignored.
 *
 * # Pattern Regex Examples: #
 *
 * <itemizedlist>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>A local H.323 endpoint with with name of "myname@myhost.com"
 * that receives a call with a destination h323Id of "boris" would
 * generate:</para>
 * <para>"h323:myname@myhost.com\\tboris"</para>
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>A local SIP endpoint with with name of "fred@nurk.com" that
 * receives a call with a destination of "sip:fred@nurk.com" would
 * generate:</para>
 * <para>"sip:fred@nurk.com\\tsip:fred@nurk.com"</para>
 * </listitem>
 * <listitem>
 * <para>Using line 0 of a PhoneJACK handset with a serial # of
 * 01AB3F4 to dial the digits 2, 6 and # would generate:<para>
 * <para>"pots:Quicknet:01AB3F4:0\\t26"</para>
 * </listitem>
 * </itemizedlist>
 *
 * # Destination meta-strings: #
 *
 * The available meta-strings are:
 *
 *       <da>    Replaced by the "b_party" string. For example
 *               "pc:.*\\t.* = sip:<da>" directs calls to the SIP protocol. In
 *               this case there is a special condition where if the original
 *               destination had a valid protocol, eg h323:fred.com, then
 *               the entire string is replaced not just the <da> part.
 *
 *       <db>    Same as <da>, but without the special condition.
 *
 *       <du>    Copy the "user" part of the "b_party" string. This is
 *               essentially the component after the : and before the '@', or
 *               the whole "b_party" string if these are not present.
 *
 *       <!du>   The rest of the "b_party" string after the <du> section. The
 *               protocol is still omitted. This is usually the '@' and onward.
 *               Note if there is already an '@' in the destination before the
 *               <!du> and what is abour to replace it also has an '@' then
 *               everything between the @ and the <!du> (inclusive) is deleted,
 *               then the substitution is made so a legal URL can result.
 *
 *       <dn>    Copy all valid consecutive E.164 digits from the "b_party" so
 *               pots:0061298765\@vpb:1/2 becomes sip:0061298765@carrier.com
 *
 *       <dnX>   As above but skip X digits, eg <dn2> skips 2 digits, so
 *               pots:00612198765 becomes sip:61298765@carrier.com
 *
 *       <!dn>   The rest of the "b_party" after the <dn> or <dnX> sections.
 *
 *       <dn2ip> Translate digits separated by '*' characters to an IP
 *               address. e.g. 10*0*1*1 becomes 10.0.1.1, also
 *               1234*10*0*1*1 becomes 1234\@10.0.1.1 and
 *               1234*10*0*1*1*1722 becomes 1234\@10.0.1.1:1722.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if an entry was added.
